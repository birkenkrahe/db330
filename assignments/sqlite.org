The following SQLite file does not do much. It only starts SQLite and
prints the ~PATH~ to the persistent database used by the program.

Before we can execute SQLite, we need to create an (empty) database
file. This file can have any name but it must end in ~.db~.

To create an empty file in Windows, open a shell in Emacs and enter
~touch sqlite.db~ at the prompt, or execute the following code block:

#+name: create db
#+begin_src bash :results none
  touch sqlite.db
#+end_src

In the next code block, we use ~sqlite.db~ as a header argument.

#+name: check db
#+begin_src sqlite :db sqlite.db
  .database
#+end_src
