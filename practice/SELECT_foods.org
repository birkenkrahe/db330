* README

  * This is the first of several notebooks to practice SQL using the
    SQLite database management system with real data.

  * Take a look at the meta data header of this file and make sure
    that you understand what the ~#+PROPERTY~ lines mean.
  
* Download sample data

  * [ ] Download the sample data ~foods.sql~ from Schoology using your
    browser.

  * [ ] Open a terminal and go to the download directory - most likely
    ~C:\Downloads~ - with the command ~cd C:\Downloads~.

  * [ ] Create an SQLite database by typing at the terminal prompt:
    #+begin_example
    sqlite3 foods.db < foods.sql
    #+end_example
    This runs SQLite on the SQLite data and generates a binary
    database file.

  * [ ] Check your progress by looking up the tables in ~foods.db~.
    #+begin_src sqlite :db foods.db

    #+end_src
    There should be four tables: ~episodes~, ~food_types~, ~foods~,
    and ~foods_episodes~.

* Getting to know the data

  * [ ] You'll learn more about the data later. Here is an Entity
    Relationship Diagram that shows the four different tables together
    with their attributes:

  * [ ] The database contains all episode titles of the popular TV show
    "Seinfeld" together with the foods shown in each episode, and the
    types of food.

  * Let's get started with a few simple queries. Put the query into
    the code block and run it with ~C-c C-c~.

  * [ ] How many food types are there?

    #+name: no_of_food_types_1
    #+begin_src sqlite :db foods.db

    #+end_src


  * [ ] Run the previous query again, but this time show what the
    result means by naming the header appropriately.

    #+name: no_of_food_types_2
    #+begin_src sqlite :db foods.db :results output

    #+end_src

    
  * [ ] Let's use another function: what is the (alphabetically) last
    episode?

    #+begin_src sqlite :db foods.db :results output

    #+end_src
