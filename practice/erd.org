* README

  * This is a notebook for learning and practicing modeling relational
    databases using Entity Relationship Diagrams, keys and bridge
    tables

  * Though we won't get more deeply into database design,
    understanding relationships, you need to understand this to
    understand ~JOIN~ commands when querying relational databases

  * The notebook also contains two practice exercises for you to
    complete on your own in a self-guided lab session.

  * *Modeling* is an essential IT design skill. You can model:
    - Technical processes (e.g. with UML)
    - Human processes (e.g. with BPMN)
    - Algorithms (e.g. with pseudocode or flowcharts)
    - Entity relationships (e.g. with ERDs)

* ERD notations

  * Relational database design relies on table relationships
  * This is especially important for ~JOIN~ operations
  * There are two dominant notations for ERD[fn:1]

** Chen

   * *Notation Example*

   #+attr_html: :width 500px
   #+caption: ERD Chen notation example (Source: Dybka, 2014)
   [[./img/chen.png]]

   * ~BOOK~ and ~CHAPTER~ are two entities (tables)
   * A ~BOOK~ fully ~CONTAINS~ 1...N ~CHAPTER~ entities
   * The ~CHAPTER~ is a fully dependent child of ~BOOK~
   * The ~CHAPTER~ totally participates in the ~BOOK~
   * The ~BOOK~ has attributes ~TITLE~ and ~BOOK_ID~
   * ~BOOK_ID~ is a /Primary Key/ (~PK~) of ~BOOK~
   * The ~CHAPTER~ has attributes ~TITLE~ and ~CHAPTER_ID~
   * The ~CHAPTER_ID~ is a /Primary Key/ (~PK~) of ~CHAPTER~

** Crow's foot--

   * *Notation summary*

     * A box represents an *entity*, e.g. ~book~

     * An entity has *attributes*, e.g. ~book_id~, ~book_title~ etc.

       #+attr_html: :width 300px
       #+caption: Entity with attributes
       [[./img/entity.png]]

     * The attributes can be overloaded with additional properties
       like /Primary Key/, /Foreign Key/, and they have types like
       /integer/, /text/ etc.

       #+attr_html: :width 300px
       #+caption: Entity with overloaded attributes
       [[./img/overloaded.png]]

     * Lines between entities represent a (binary) *relationship*

     * Relationships have two indicators: *maximum* (aka multiplicity) and *minimum*

     * Multiplicity = /maximum/ number of associations between the entities

       #+attr_html: :width 500px
       #+caption: Multiplicity (Source: Dybka, 2016)
       [[./img/multiplicity.png]]

     * Example 1: "A book has one and only one ISBN."
     * Example 2: "A book has many chapters."

       #+attr_html: :width 500px

     * Example 3: "A book has at least one chapter."
     * Example 4: "A book has no or many new editions."

* Food database revisited
** Create diagram with ~draw.io~

   * [ ] Open [[https://draw.io][draw.io]] - you can choose where to save your diagrams

   * [ ] If you choose Google Drive, you need to sign in to authorize
     as shown in the image.

     #+attr_html: :width 500px
     #+caption: draw.io authorization dialog
     [[./img/drawio.png]]

   * [ ] When you've authorized the storage place, you can create a
     new diagram. Don't bother with the templates.

   * [ ] [[https://youtu.be/gCranxLqZDI][This short video]] shows how to create an entity and
     relationships between them using the crow's foot notation.

** Create diagram

   * [ ] /Zoom to Width/ using the menu (left bottom of screen)
   * [ ] Highlight and delete the diagrams on the screen
   * [ ] Drag a table template onto the drawing board
   * [ ] Draw the 4 entity diagrams for the food database

     #+attr_html: :width 500px
     #+caption: ERD of the food database (Source: Allen/Owens, 2010)
     [[./img/food.png]]

   * [ ] Write down the relationships between ~food_types~ and
     ~food~. Remember that you're not trying to describe all possible
     relationships but only the relationship for the purpose of this
     database with its narrow meaning: types of foods shown in
     episodes of the Seinfeld TV show.

     #+begin_quote

* ~food_types~ to ~food~: each food type has zero or many instances
  of food in the show.

* ~food~ to ~food_types~: each food on the show is exactly one type
  of food.

  #+end_quote

* Practice: customer orders

  * [X] Develop an ER diagram with three tables: ~customer~, ~order~, and ~product~

  * [X] Identify suitable attributes

  * [X] The diagram should allow for relationships like
    - "A customer submits an order"
    - "An order contains a product"
    - "An order belongs to a customer"
    - "A product is part of an order."

  * [X] Use draw.io to draw the diagram

  * [X] Draw relationships with the correct minimum/maximum

  * [ ] Give your diagram a title

  * [ ] Share the link to your solution with me via Email

* Practice exercise (due Thursday, 7 April 4 pm)

  * [ ] Develop an ER diagram with relationships between *four* tables:
    ~Student~, ~Course~, ~Lecturer~, and ~Class~ (or meeting).

  * [ ] Identify suitable attributes: make sure that they are
    - measurable (you can think of a suitable data type)
    - atomic (~address~ is composite, ~street~, ~street number~ are atomic)
    - attributes (like ~name~) and not entities (like ~registrar~) or
      relationships (like ~attendance~) themselves

  * [ ] The diagram should allow for relationships like
    - "A student is enroled in a course."
    - "A class is attended by students."
    - "An lecturer offers a course."
    - "A class is taught by an lecturer."
    - etc.

  * [ ] Use draw.io to draw the final ERD (see [[https://youtu.be/gCranxLqZDI][demo video]])

  * [ ] Draw relationships with the correct minimum/maximum

  * [ ] Put ~ERD assignment by [Your name] - Pledged~ in the title of
    your diagram

  * [ ] Upload a screenshot of your solution to Schoology

** Sample solution

   * All relationships are subject to *business rules*. E.g. at least one
     student may have to be enroled in a course, or a lecturer may only
     be allowed to give a certain number of lectures - or reversely, a
     lecture may have to have at least one lecturer assigned to it.

   * Because business rules change, the relationship structure of the
     database may also change. The schema, reflected in the entity
     relationship diagram, reflects this ([[https://editor.ponyorm.com/user/birkenkrahe/Team/designer][source diagram at ponyorm]]).

     #+name: fig:students
     #+attr_html: :width 600px
     #+caption: Sample solution (part) for students db
     [[./img/students.png]]

   * Important to note:
     - Each lecturer can teach many courses (or none)
     - Each course can only be taught by exactly one lecturer
     - Each course can have many students (or none)
     - Each student can have many courses (or none)

* Keys and bridge tables

** PK Definition

   * A *primary key* (~PK~) is an attribute (or column) that uniquely
     identifies every record in a certain table.

   * We already marked the potential PKs in the figure
     [[fig:customer_ERD]].

   * Primary key rules:

     1) *UNIQUE* (across the database, i.e. all tables)
     2) *unchangeable* (while the table exists)
     3) *NOT NULL*

** Key candidate identification

   Example table:

   |    id | fname | lname | street          | city       |   zip |        phone |
   |-------+-------+-------+-----------------+------------+-------+--------------|
   | 30014 | John  | Smith | 1014 Main St    | Batesville | 72501 | 870-307-4245 |
   | 30067 | John  | Smith | 2300 College Rd | Batesville | 72501 | 501-444-4287 |
   | 30333 | Jane  | Doe   | 1014 Main St    | Conway     | 72004 | 877-223-4445 |

   - Names, phones, addresses are not unique or unchangeable
   - ~id~ is designed to fulfil the PK rules
   - Can be "randomly" assigned (is there a problem with that?)[fn:2]

** Website example

   - If a website does not let you change your username, it likely
     uses your ~username~ as a primary key

   - If you're told that a username is already taken, the ~UNIQUE~
     condition would otherwise be violated

   - A website will force you to enter certain information for
     database reasons if the information is used to create your PK
     (~NOT NULL~)

** Foreign Keys

   * Foreign keys are primary keys in other (linked) tables

   * Example from the customer example:

     #+name: fig:customer_ERD_2
     #+attr_html: :width 500px
     #+caption: PK and FK in Customer and Order (ERD)
     [[./img/customer2.png]]

     #+name: tab:customer_ERD_2
     #+attr_html: :width 500px
     #+caption: PK and FK in Customer and Order (tables)
     [[./img/customer2table.png]]

   * Foreign keys do not need to be unique (a customer could make
     another order) and there can be multiple foreign keys in one
     entity - if we want to link information across multiple tables.

   * Example: ~product_id~ in a customer order. Now the order table has
     two foreign keys, ~customer_id~ and ~product_id~.

     #+name: fig:customer_ERD_3
     #+attr_html: :width 500px
     #+caption: PK and FK in Order and Product (ERD)
     [[./img/customer3.png]]


** Composite primary key

   * Let's say, an order is sent in two different shipments.

     #+name: tab:shipment
     #+attr_html: :width 500px
     #+caption: Two orders in the shipment table
     [[./img/shipment.png]]

   * We need a composite primary key, because none of the individual
     IDs will satisfy our rules - none are unique:
     - Someone else might order the same product (~Product_ID~)
     - Products might be in the same order (~Order_ID~)
     - Time and date could coincide

   * The pair ~(Product_ID, Order_ID)~ is unique for the shipment - it's
     a valid *composite primary key*.

   * Rules:
     - use the fewest number of attributes possible
     - attributes should be unchangeable

   * Alternative: add a ~Shipping_ID~.

** Bridge tables

   * If two tables (like ~Student~ and ~Course~ in figure [[fig:students]])
     are connected by man-to-many relationships, you need a bridge
     table to remove ambiguities.

   * Otherwise, many details are not accessible: e.g. without the
     Order table, you would not know how many products a customer
     bought, or when he made individual purchases.

   * With the order table, each time a product is purchased, there is
     a record in the order table about when and how many products.

   * The easiest way to generate a bridge table is by creating an
     intermediate table with only two columns that together form the
     composite key.

   * For example, for the ~student~-~course~ relationship, this could be a
     table ~enrolment~ with the primary key ~(student_id,
     course_id)~. Such a table could record all kinds of enrolment
     data.

* Object relations mapper

  * [[https://editor.ponyorm.com][Ponyorm]] is a (free) example, and Lucidchart and other apps also
    offer this option - translate an ERD model into a database.

  * The other way around is also possible and common: visualizing an
    existing database. Recommended for SQLite: [[https://dbeaver.io/][DBeaver (open source)]].

[fn:2]Yes - (1) computers cannot generate true random numbers; (2) the
basis for the number may over time get exhausted - this happened
e.g. with IPv4 addresses (see "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion][IPv4 address exhaustion]]").

[fn:1]Notation reflects priorities, e.g. readibility vs. detail. It is
surprising that there aren't more popular notations!  Notation must
faithfully represent the modeling standard. You can in fact become
famous with notation - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram][Feynman diagrams]] are an example: they are a
diagrammatic language for complicated integrals that represent
elementary particle interactions.
