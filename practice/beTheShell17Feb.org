  You can perform all of these commands inside an Org-mode file to
  keep them, or on the command line, if you don't care about losing
  it - see [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/db330/blob/main/notes.org#db-dump-and-output-select-pipeline---w6s10---february-17-2022][class notes]] (GitHub) and my [[https://youtu.be/-mKBQdgZFTE][screencast on YouTube]] with a

  1) [X] Start SQLite with header on and column mode switched on from
     the command line (to find out, look at ~sqlite3 --help~)

  2) [X] Check that you don't have a persistent database with ~.database~

  3) [X] Open your (existing) database ~sqlite.db~ with ~.open~

  4) [X] Check that you're now writing to ~sqlite.db~

  5) [X] Check that in fact header is ~ON~ and the mode is ~column~
     - with ~.show~ to show all output values
     - with ~SELECT~
  6) [X] Switch the output to a file with ~.output feb17.sql~
  7) [X] Dump the content of your database with ~.dump~
  8) [X] Switch the output back to ~stdout~
  9) [X] Dump the content of your database again
  10) [X] Leave the SQLite shell and look at ~feb17.sql~
