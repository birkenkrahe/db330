* SQLite
** Delete tables

   * ~DROP TABLE [table];~

   * PRACTICE

** Export table content only

   * You already know how to ~.dump~ an SQLite database ~.db~

   * Sometimes, you only want to export the data only, without the
     .~schema~

   * For this, you can use ~.mode insert~, then redirect the ~.output~
     and ~SELECT~ the data for the output file

   * PRACTICE

** Export a CSV file

   * First export your file as a CSV file

   * Change ~.mode~, ~SELECT~, change ~.output~, ~SELECT~ again

   * Now you have a CSV file to import

   * PRACTICE

** Import a CSV file

   * ~.import [csv file] [table]~

   * See help for ~.import~ on the SQLite shell

   * If you have an error, how can you fix it?

   * PRACTICE

** Unique constraints
   * Unique constraints: ~PRIMARY KEY~

   * What happens if you have defined a column ~id~ as ~PRIMARY KEY~?

   * Try to ~INSERT~ the same ~VALUE~ in a table that already has one

   * Use ~.schema [table]~ to see your table definitions

   * PRACTICE

** UPDATE TABLE (DML)

   * ~UPDATE~ table values with ~UPDATE [table] SET [col]=[new];~

   * If you're not careful you update entries that don't need it

   * How can you specify a row and leave others unchanged?

   * Use a filter with ~WHERE~ to specify the row!

   * PRACTICE

** ALTER TABLE (DDL)

   * SQLite has limited capabilities to alter tables

   * You can change the name, or you can add a column, that's it

   * ~ALTER TABLE [table] RENAME TO [newname];~

   * Add a column with ~ALTER TABLE [table] ADD COLUMN [name] TEXT;~

   * PRACTICE

** NULL values

   * ~NULL~ values are special, too

   * Check out the ~.nullvalue~ setting via ~.show~

   * Set it to ~[NULL]~ (default is "")

   * ~SELECT~ all columns of the table you just added a column to

   * Add a new column and label it ~NOT NULL~

   * PRACTICE
