* How to run SQLite in Emacs

  This refers to running SQLite inside an Emacs Org-mode code block -
  the ability to program SQLite in a literate way. This ability is
  coded in the Org-mode Babel file ~ob-sqlite.el~. You need to have
  the following code in your Emacs file *after* loading ~ob-sqlite~:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'ob-sqlite) 
    (setq org-babel-sqlite3-command "c:/Program Files (x86)/sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3360000/sqlite3.exe")
  #+end_src

  You can check that the variable is loaded properly by entering

  #+begin_example
  C-h v org-babel-sqlite3-command RET
  #+end_example
