* What is this?

  This is a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file for this course. For

* Running SQLite in an Emacs shell

  * It's bugged me from the start of the course that GNU Emacs on
    Windoze did not seem to allow to run SQLite in a shell. Turns out
    that's not true! The issue is merely cosmetic: the SQLite shell
    prompt is not shown is all.

  * Here are a couple of screenshots both from Windoze - the first is
    the SQLite shell inside an terminal Emacs shell (start Emacs from
    the CMD line with ~emacs -nw~), the second is from within the
    Ubuntu app (20.04 LTS), also the terminal Emacs.

* How to run SQLite in Emacs Org-mode

  This refers to running SQLite inside an Emacs Org-mode code block -
  the ability to program SQLite in a literate way. This ability is
  coded in the Org-mode Babel file ~ob-sqlite.el~. You need to have
  the following code in your Emacs file *after* loading ~ob-sqlite~:

  #+name: set org-babel-sqlite3-command
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports both :results raw
    (require 'ob-sqlite)
    (setq org-babel-sqlite3-command "\"c:/Program Files (x86)/sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3360000/sqlite3.exe\"")

  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: set org-babel-sqlite3-command
  "c:/Program Files (x86)/sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3360000/sqlite3.exe"

  You can check that the variable is loaded properly by entering:

  #+begin_example
  C-h v org-babel-sqlite3-command RET
  #+end_example

  Babel reports that "this variable may be risky if used as a
  file-local variable," but I suppose we've got to take our chances!

* Control question (test 1) on cloud services

  The test question was:
  #+begin_quote
  "Order the three cloud architectures [SaaS, PaaS, IaaS] according to
  decreasing control (from top = most, to bottom = least
  control). Tip: more "control" means greater ability of the
  organization buying the cloud service from a provider, to control
  the organization's information technology."
  #+end_quote

  *Student question*
  #+begin_quote
  "I just had a question about this particular question.  As you can
  see, I got it all incorrect. My thought process was that, as a user,
  I have most control with Infrastructure as a Service (for example,
  using my own car). And Saas has the least control from the user
  using a company (like public transport) (I'm using the analogies
  from Data Camp.)  Could we go over this one later?"
  #+end_quote

  *Answer*
  #+begin_quote
  "IaaS, PaaS, SaaS are specific to cloud infrastructure - the car
  metaphor is not really very good, I think. It is used in the lesson
  to suggest that, as a car owner, you have much less responsibility,
  and nothing to worry about when you go IaaS. Alas, that also means
  that you have no control as the customer. When you look at the image
  from DataCamp, you can see that the VENDOR (aka provider)
  MANAGES. Who manages has control, the user has the convenience. In
  the public transport example: if the vendor (= city/transport
  company) decides to discontinue the service, you've got nothing. As
  an On-Premise car owner you have all the trouble, but all the
  control, too."
  #+end_quote

  The confusion with regard to the diagram shown by DataCamp that
  ordered SaaS, PaaS and IaaS came about because their term "control"
  related to loss of control from greater complexity (or greater
  "abstraction"), for both provider and customer, while I was asking
  about the customer specifically - actually more relevant in
  practice.

  Complexity/abstraction as used in the DataCamp lesson is an
  important parameter in system design but less relevant for the
  customer, more relevant for the provider.
