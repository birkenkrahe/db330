* README

  This file contains the agenda overview (what I had planned), the
  objectives (what we managed to do) and (much of the) content of each
  taught session of the course. I want to avoid splitting the content
  up over many files - so that you have to navigate as little as
  possible (like a book)!

  The companion file to this file, less structured and with the
  captain's log, is the [[file:notes.org][notes.org]] file.

     [[./img/issue.png]]
     -----
     #+begin_quote
     If you do have a GitHub account already, do the exercise anyway
     using your existing account (it takes 10 min)! Make sure you
     let me know what your user name is so that I can add you to my
     repo.
     #+end_quote

    #+attr_html: :width 400px
    [[./img/emacs.png]]

    * Why are we using it?
      - To mix documentation + code + output = literate programming
        (1984)
      - It's the same thing as an interactive computing notebook
        (Jupyter) ... except open to ALL languages and outputs

   * What infrastructure is required? Can you do this yourself?

   * What did I think about the assignment? ([[file:notes.org::DataCamp assignment - cloud deployment][notes]])

** Database management foundations - 10 tenets

   1) A database (DB) is a collection of related data items within
      a specific business process or problem setting.

   2) A database management system (DBMS) is the software package used
      to define, create, use and maintain a database.

   3) We distinguish the file-based vs. DB approach to data management
      (data from different application stored in different files
      vs. managed by one application and one shared, central database)

   4) Metadata are data (structure) definitions, like ownership or
      number of tables, and are stored in the DB catalog or
      dictionary.
      
   5) DBMS provide DB languages (like SQL) that facilitate data
      definition (DDL), data manipulation (DML), data querying (DQL),
      and data control (DCL).

   6) The database model (or schema) describes the DB data
      structure. It does not change easily, and is stored in the
      catalog. Examples are: entities stored (e.g. as tables), and
      entity aspects (e.g. as columns). To model, we use ERDs.

   8) The database state, or set of instances, represents the data in
      the DB at a given moment in time, viewed using the DB language
      (DQL). Examples are DB records (rows) from subsequent
      observations.

   9) DB follow a 3-layer design: an internal technical layer
      (e.g. server, file, network organisation), a conceptual/logical
      layer (e.g. the schema), and an external layer (views of the
      data provided e.g. by SQL queries).

   10) There are different types of DB users, with different skill
       sets: information (cloud) architects; DB designers (ERD); DB
       Administrators (SQL, Linux); Application Developers (e.g. Web
       App); Business Users (SQL).
   
** Practice: SQLite Basics

   We'll learn more about SQLite in future sessions. This is just to
   get our feet wet, including some important file system aspects.
   
   #+begin_example
   $ sqlite3
   sqlite> .database
   sqlite> .q
   $ touch test.db  # this only works if you have 'touch' installed, e.g.
                    # via the cygwin utility bundle
   $ fsutil file createNew test.db 0 # creates an empty file in ./
   $ sqlite3 test.db
   sqlite> .database
   sqlite> .q
   #+end_example   

   As you can see, it's never easy to do anything in Windows. We're
   better off writing SQLite code in Emacs where the ~.db~ file is
   automatically created (see [[https://lyon.schoology.com/assignment/5603361550/info][assignment]]). If this doesn't work for
   you, contact me and we'll sort you out!

[fn:2]In Lyon 104 (Computer lab), the ~PATH~ variable is unfortunately
stored in the personal user's app data so that I could not set it
properly for your account (you can do this on your own PC
easily). However, [[file:FAQ.org][I seem to have found a solution]] for this ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/db330/blob/main/FAQ.org#how-to-run-sqlite-in-emacs][see course
FAQ]]).

[fn:1]For installation on your PC, see [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/emacs/install.org][these instructions]] ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/emacs/install.pdf][PDF]]). The
installation is simple: download the ZIP file, unpack it, and set the
~PATH~ variable so that sqlite can be found.
