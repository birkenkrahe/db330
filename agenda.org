**** Why are we using it?

     /Image: Org-mode file in GitHub/
     #+attr_html: :width 500px
     [[./img/org.png]]

     * It's free
     * To host course materials
     * Upload assignments (esp. Emacs Org-files)
     * Discussion
     * Wiki for collaboration
     * Complements Schoology[fn:2]

**** What will you have to do?

     * [[https://github.com][Sign up with GitHub]] - use Lyon Email
     * Pick an available username *using your own first and last name*,
       e.g. ~MarcusBirkenkrahe~, or ~DonaldTrump~
     * [[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world][Complete the "Hello World" exercise]] ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.md#completing-the-github-hello-world-exercise][FAQ]])
     * Give me your GitHub username so that I can add you as a
       collaborator to my private ~db330~ repository
     * [[https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-repository][Create an issue]] from the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc100/issues][~db330~ repository]] like in the example
       below (except from your account instead of mine).

     [[./img/issue.png]]
     -----
     #+begin_quote
     If you do have a GitHub account already, do the exercise anyway
     using your existing account (it takes 10 min)! Make sure you
     let me know what your user name is so that I can add you to my
     repo.
     #+end_quote

**** What else can you do?

     * You can [[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo][fork]] the [[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo][~db330~]] repository
     * You can [[https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/managing-subscriptions-for-activity-on-github/viewing-your-subscriptions][watch]] the [[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo][~db330~]] repository - and set [[https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications][~Notifications~]] to
       ~Participating and @mentions~ so that you see my comments (see
       image below).

    * Why are we using it?
      - To mix documentation + code + output = literate programming
        (1984)
      - It's the same thing as an interactive computing notebook
        (Jupyter) ... except open to ALL languages and outputs

   I forgot to mention this in the last class. This is the first DataCamp assignment. It is informational and very simple - nothing but drag and drop practice and a few videos. This should not take you longer than 15-20 minutes.

   We'll pick up on past assignments in class - short review including questions for the audience (you!)
   Completing this assignment on time gets you 10 points (100%).
   Late completion (after the due date): 5 points (50%).

** Database management foundations - 10 tenets

   1) A database (DB) is a collection of related data items within
      a specific business process or problem setting.

   2) A database management system (DBMS) is the software package used
      to define, create, use and maintain a database.

   3) We distinguish the file-based vs. DB approach to data management
      (data from different application stored in different files
      vs. managed by one application and one shared, central database)

   4) Metadata are data (structure) definitions, like ownership or
      number of tables, and are stored in the DB catalog or
      dictionary.
      
   5) DBMS provide DB languages (like SQL) that facilitate data
      definition (DDL), data manipulation (DML), data querying (DQL),
      and data control (DCL).

   6) The database model (or schema) describes the DB data
      structure. It does not change easily, and is stored in the
      catalog. Examples are: entities stored (e.g. as tables), and
      entity aspects (e.g. as columns). To model, we use ERDs.

   8) The database state, or set of instances, represents the data in
      the DB at a given moment in time, viewed using the DB language
      (DQL). Examples are DB records (rows) from subsequent
      observations.

   9) DB follow a 3-layer design: an internal technical layer
      (e.g. server, file, network organisation), a conceptual/logical
      layer (e.g. the schema), and an external layer (views of the
      data provided e.g. by SQL queries).

   10) There are different types of DB users, with different skill
       sets: information (cloud) architects; DB designers (ERD); DB
       Administrators (SQL, Linux); Application Developers (e.g. Web
       App); Business Users (SQL).
   
** Practice: SQLite Basics

   We'll learn more about SQLite in future sessions. This is just to
   get our feet wet, including some important file system aspects.
   
   #+begin_example
   $ sqlite3
   sqlite> .database
   sqlite> .q
   $ touch test.db
   $ sqlite3 test.db
   sqlite> .database
   sqlite> .q
   #+end_example   
   
** What's next?

   * Architecture and classification of databases (text book)
   * Next DataCamp assignment due Feb 8 ("Cloud providers/cases")

[fn:4]In Lyon 104 (Computer lab), the ~PATH~ variable is unfortunately
stored in the personal user's app data so that I could not set it
properly for your account (you can do this on your own PC
easily). However, [[file:FAQ.org::How to run SQLite in Emacs][I seem to have found a solution]] for this ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/db330/blob/main/FAQ.org#how-to-run-sqlite-in-emacs][see course
FAQ]]).

[fn:1]For installation on your PC, see [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/emacs/install.org][these instructions]] ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/emacs/install.pdf][PDF]]). The
installation is simple: download the ZIP file, unpack it, and set the
~PATH~ variable so that sqlite can be found.
