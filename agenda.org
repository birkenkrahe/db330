  This file contains the agenda overview (what I had planned), the
  objectives (what we managed to do) and (much of the) content of each
  taught session of the course. I want to avoid splitting the content
  up over many files - so that you have to navigate as little as
  possible (like a book)!

  The companion file to this file, less structured and with the
  captain's log, is the [[file:notes.org][notes.org]] file.

** Database management foundations - 10 tenets

   1) A database (DB) is a collection of related data items within
      a specific business process or problem setting.

   2) A database management system (DBMS) is the software package used
      to define, create, use and maintain a database.

   3) We distinguish the file-based vs. DB approach to data management
      (data from different application stored in different files
      vs. managed by one application and one shared, central database)

   4) Metadata are data (structure) definitions, like ownership or
      number of tables, and are stored in the DB catalog or
      dictionary.

   5) DBMS provide DB languages (like SQL) that facilitate data
      definition (DDL), data manipulation (DML), data querying (DQL),
      and data control (DCL).

   6) The database model (or schema) describes the DB data
      structure. It does not change easily, and is stored in the
      catalog. Examples are: entities stored (e.g. as tables), and
      entity aspects (e.g. as columns). To model, we use ERDs.

   8) The database state, or set of instances, represents the data in
      the DB at a given moment in time, viewed using the DB language
      (DQL). Examples are DB records (rows) from subsequent
      observations.

   9) DB follow a 3-layer design: an internal technical layer
      (e.g. server, file, network organisation), a conceptual/logical
      layer (e.g. the schema), and an external layer (views of the
      data provided e.g. by SQL queries).

   10) There are different types of DB users, with different skill
       sets: information (cloud) architects; DB designers (ERD); DB
       Administrators (SQL, Linux); Application Developers (e.g. Web
       App); Business Users (SQL).

** Practice: SQLite Basics

   We'll learn more about SQLite in future sessions. This is just to
   get our feet wet, including some important file system aspects.

   #+begin_example
   $ sqlite3
   sqlite> .database
   sqlite> .q
   $ touch test.db  # this only works if you have 'touch' installed, e.g.
                    # via the cygwin utility bundle
   $ fsutil file createNew test.db 0 # creates an empty file in ./
   $ sqlite3 test.db
   sqlite> .database
   sqlite> .q
   #+end_example

   As you can see, it's never easy to do anything in Windows. We're
   better off writing SQLite code in Emacs where the ~.db~ file is
   automatically created (see [[https://lyon.schoology.com/assignment/5603361550/info][assignment]]). If this doesn't work for
   you, contact me and we'll sort you out!

** Objectives

   * [X] More SQLite command line practice

   * [X]  SQLite lab session

** SQLite Lab session

   You should type the commands shown here into your own SQLite shell
   to get some practice -

   * To open SQLite under Windows, open a CMD shell and type
     ~sqlite3~. If this does not work, you either have not installed
     the program, or you don't have the location of the executable
     ~sqlite3.exe~ in the ~$PATH~ of your PC.

   * To find the ~$PATH~ to the executable, open an ~*eshell*~ in Emacs
     (~M-x eshell~) and type ~which sqlite3~ (that's a Linux shell command,
     and Emacs simulates Linux shell commands using Emacs Lisp).

   * Inside SQLite, on the SQLite shell (indicated by the prompt
     ~sqlite>~), you need to operate with a persistent database file
     that must have the ending ~*.db~.

   * The output to the code in [[check_db]] shows 1) we have a persistent
     database that we're currently writing to, 2) where the file is, 3)
     we have no tables (yet).

     #+name: check_db
     #+begin_src sqlite :db sqlite.db :results output :exports both
       .database
       .tables
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: check_db
     : main: c:\Users\birkenkrahe\Documents\GitHub\db330\sqlite.db r/w
     : customer

   * To create a table, we need SQL commands (not just SQLite shell
     commands). In [[create]], the SQL keywords are all capitalized though
     SQLite doesn't actually care about that.

     #+name: create
     #+begin_example sqlite
       CREATE TABLE customer (id INT, name TEXT);
     #+end_example

     - ~customer~ is the name of our table
     - ~id~ and ~name~ are the two columns of our table (stuff we wish
       to store)
     - ~INT~ and ~TEXT~ are two SQLite data types

   * ~CREATE TABLE~ is a DDL (Data Definition Language) command. We
     now have a table but no content.

     #+name: .tables
     #+begin_src sqlite :db sqlite.db :exports both
       .tables
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: .tables
     : customer

   * ~INSERT INTO~ is a DML (Data Manipulation Language) command. We
     insert two lines. The result is silent.

     #+name: insert
     #+begin_example sqlite
       INSERT INTO customer VALUES (1,"Jimmy Jones");
       INSERT INTO customer VALUES (2,"Jane Jackson");
     #+end_example

   * To look at what we've entered, we use the ~SELECT~ command, a DQL
     (Data Query Language) command.

     #+name: select
     #+begin_example sqlite
       SELECT * FROM customer;
     #+end_example
     - This command is best understood as a data pipeline (more later)
     - Its general form is ~SELECT [cols] FROM [table] [filter]~
     - The wildcard symbol ~*~ means "all columns" of the table

     #+RESULTS: select
     | 1 | Jimmy Jones  |
     | 2 | Jane Jackson |

** Test review
*** Test 1 results

    * I think the results are actually very decent - > 75% is a
      good result - better next time!
      #+caption: Test 1 results (Schoology)
      #+attr_html: :width 500px
      [[./img/test_1_stats.png]]

    * What surprised me most was that many of you did not use the
      available time. Alas, the stats don't show this number. A quick
      glance does not seem to reveal any clear pattern.

    * I am an obsessive fact-checker. When checking the stats with R, I
      find slightly different results:
      #+name: test 1 results
      #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
        results <- c(17.88,15.8,16.67,12.32,9.54,16.56,12.31,12.78,14.33,
                     18.67,18,17.56,12.64,15.56,15.86,14.64,13.96,14.75,16.43,
                     15.58,16.44,13.98,18.56,14.91,13.11,17,16.33,17.21)
        length(results)
        sd(results)
        summary(results)
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS: test 1 results
      :
      : [1] 28
      :
      : [1] 2.193788
      :
      :    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
      :    9.54   13.97   15.69   15.34   16.75   18.67

    * Let's make some plots: histogram, boxplot and density plot. I'd
      like the histogram and the density plot (a smoothened histogram)
      to peak more to the right, and for the boxplot to be smaller and
      higher up.
      #+name: histogram
      #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output graphics file :file ./img/test1hist.png
        hist(results, main="Histogram of test 1 results, CSC 330 Spring 2022")
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS: histogram
      [[file:./img/test1hist.png]]

      #+name: boxplot
      #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output graphics file :file ./img/test1box.png
        boxplot(results, main="Test 1 results, CSC 330 Spring 2022")
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS: boxplot
      [[file:./img/test1box.png]]

      #+name: density
      #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output graphics file :file ./img/test1density.png
        ave <- mean(results)
        d <- density(results)
        plot(d, col="steelblue",main="Test 1 Results CSC 330 Spring 2022")
        abline(v=ave,col="red")
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS: density
      [[file:./img/test1density.png]]

*** Analysis - feedback and action points

    * Test 1 can now be played an unlimited number of times. I have
      added feedback to all new questions.

    * What surprised me most was that many of you did not use the
      available time. However, I have not (yet) been able to correlate
      test time and test success.

    * See also: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/diary.org#i-can-teach-it-to-you-but-i-cannot-learn-it-for-you]["I can teach it to you but I cannot learn it for you"]]

    * Questions:
      - How did you study for this test?
      - If you didn't perform well, what will you change?
      - What can I do to help you help yourself?

    * Changes to be applied in future quizzes/tests:
      - Fewer multiple choices (max. 4)
      - Announce if a question has > 1 answer (and/or how many)

*** Individual questions

    Some questions do not accept a feedback option. I have put a GitHub
    link into the question field.

    * See [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/db330/blob/main/FAQ.org#control-question-test-1-on-cloud-services][the FAQ]] for a question on the problem of "decreasing control"
      for different cloud computing architectures. Some of you will get
      points for giving the correct order, irrespective of the
      direction - because indeed there was a conflict with the DataCamp
      image showing that "control" decreases from IaaS to SaaS, and not
      the other way around - because this was with regard to loss of
      control from complexity, for both provider and customer, while I
      was asking about the customer specifically. Complexity/abstraction
      is an important parameter in system design but less relevant for
      the customer, more relevant for the provider.

**** Customer control for different cloud architectures (Ø=0.46)

     [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/db330/blob/main/FAQ.org#control-question-test-1-on-cloud-services][See FAQ]] - student question and answer.

**** How does MooCall sensor operate? (Ø=0.96)

     Bring the following processes in the right order.

     1) Edge computing: data are generated and pre-processed locally
     2) Cloud computing: data are processed globally to generate a signal
     3) Local computing: signal is transmitted to the user

     Feedback: The sensor is attached to the cow's tail. It records
     data as signals in the form of temperature, motion, etc. In
     relation to the cloud, the sensor (a microcontroller with minimal
     operating and processing capabilities) operators "on the edge" (of
     the cloud). It has likely an SQLite database on board, or perhaps
     something even simpler. Gathering the data and writing them to a
     file if only for transport to the cloud is the "preprocessing". In
     the next step, the signal for the end user is prepared once the
     data (from different cows, and over a longer period of time) are
     now "in the cloud". In practice this means that they are now in a
     database on a server, very likely in tabular form. The processing
     in the cloud generates a signal for the end user when the evidence
     is conclusive, and when the software used to process the data has
     reached a positive prediction: "Cow is ready to calve". Only then
     the end user, the farmer, will be notified. In another scenario,
     the farmer is continuously informed about the state of the
     cow. But this does not change anything in the data processing
     pipeline.

**** Database architecture layer and example applications (Ø=88)

     This question goes back to a slide from the DB foundation
     presentation (Lemahieu et al, 2021).

     * The *external layer* is what the end-user sees - e.g. a manager
       looking at a dashboard, or using SQL to formulate a database
       query. The image shows entities and their attributes.

     * The *conceptual/logical layer* is the database schema that
       translates the user requirements - stored entities and their
       attributes - into a database schema. The "logical" part relates
       to the fact that this schema needs to fulfil certain conditions
       to be usable by the RDBMS - e.g. records need to be uniquely
       identifiable.

     * The *internal layer* refers to the physical implementation,
       e.g. the server infrastructure used to split up, or duplicate,
       databases over an international network.

**** Pros and Cons of SQLite (Ø=88)

     | PROS                    | CONS                              |
     |-------------------------+-----------------------------------|
     | Very lightweight        | No concurrency                    |
     | Zero configuration      | No user management                |
     | No library dependendies | Security - no data access control |
     | Highly portable         | Limited data types                |

     * See [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/db330/blob/main/sqlite/introduction_to_sqlite.png][Introduction to SQLite (mindmap)]]. This mindmap does not give
       an explanation (or even a source) of these properties, just a
       listing. For details, see e.g. [[https://www.keycdn.com/support/sqlite-vs-mysql][keycdn]] (2018).

**** Use case diagrams and UML (Ø=0.71)

     * UML is Unified Modeling Language - an important modeling
       framework for information systems design - from the small
       (database system) to the large (e.g. all systems of an
       airport). Use case diagrams are one of the 14 (standard) diagram
       categories of this language - and probably the easiest at that.

     * Here is a short [[https://youtu.be/zid-MVo7M-E][introductory video]] on Use Case diagrams only.

**** In research communication, "limitations" means "bias" (Ø=0.54)

     In the first video of the last DataCamp chapter on cloud computing
     for everyone, the presenter initially spends a lot of time trying
     to explain potential bias - e.g. because of the (commercial)
     sources of information. This bias effectively limits the validity
     of the presentation - high bias means that we cannot simply believe
     what we're told. Scientific publications must have a section on
     "limitations" of the research that is mainly about bias of method,
     and bias of the researcher.

**** What are "Meta Data"? (Ø=0.89)

     Meta (from Greek, "with", or "alongside") Data come with the data,
     and they are always data about data - in the case of databases,
     e.g. about the ownership of the database. Definitions, and queries
     belong to DDL, and DQL, respectively. Data design issues include
     both of these.

     An example outside of databases are the control codes for Emacs
     Org-mode files beginning with the characters ~#+~. They contain
     layout information (e.g. ~#+OPTIONS: toc:nil~) or information
     about title or authorship.

**** Database virtualization (Ø=0.61)

     Virtualization is an important principle of system abstraction:
     one abstracts from (= eliminates) the notion of physical
     location. The database appears to be in one place (at the external
     level) but at the internal level, it is distributed. The user
     never knows this.

     The same concept applies to operating systems whose
     processes are virtualized in the sense that jobs are executed by a
     concerted action of CPU, volatile memory (RAM) and non-volatile
     memory (e.g. Hard disk), while the user knows nothing about it.

**** Entering sqlite3 at the prompt opens SQLite to a transient database (Ø=0.54)
**** Which database language properties does SQLite have? (Ø=0.64)

     DDL, DML, DQL

** How do class assignments work?

   * In-class assignments are *10%* of your total grade
   * They are labeled *class assignments* in the Schoology gradebook
   * You get the points if you attend and participate *actively*
   * If you check your phone instead, you're *not* active
   * If you could not attend (with a good excuse), submit *late*
   * Submit an Org-mode file, not a screenshot

** Review of DataCamp (interactive)

   * Review dashboard: SQL shell / table view

   * ~AS~ is an alias operator: it is used in [[as]] as an alias for the
     column name.
     #+name: as
     #+begin_src sqlite :db sqlite.db
       .header ON
       .mode column
       SELECT name AS result FROM customer;
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     | result       |
     | ------------ |
     | Jimmy Jones  |
     | Jane Jackson |

   * The ~AS~ in DataCamp created a column. You can use ~SELECT~ to
     "pipe" anything into a table format.
     #+name: AS1
     #+begin_src sqlite :db select.db
       .header ON
       .mode column
       SELECT 'Hello world' AS hello;
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: as1
     | hello       |
     | ----------- |
     | Hello world |

   * Demonstration of ~DISTINCT~ using our table ~customer~.
     #+name: DISTINCT
     #+begin_src sqlite :db sqlite.db
       .header ON
       .mode column
       INSERT INTO customer VALUES (3,"Jimmy Jones");
       SELECT * FROM customer;
       SELECT DISTINCT name AS dist_name FROM customer;
       DELETE FROM customer WHERE id=3;
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: DISTINCT
     | id  name         |
     | --  ------------ |
     | 1   Jimmy Jones  |
     | 2   Jane Jackson |
     | 3   Jimmy Jones  |
     | dist_name        |
     | ------------     |
     | Jimmy Jones      |
     | Jane Jackson     |

   * Demonstration of ~COUNT~ using our table ~customer~.
     #+name: COUNT
     #+begin_src sqlite :db sqlite.db :results output
       SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer;
       INSERT INTO customer VALUES (3,"Arabela Ant");
       SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer;
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: COUNT
     : 2
     : 3

** Next

   * More SQLite (import, export, delete)

   * More SELECT (joins, filter, arithmetic)
* SQLite import/export, NULL, UNIQUE - w7s11 (22-Feb)
** Objectives

   * [X] Understand how to export table data
   * [X] Understand how to import data, especially CSV files
   * [X] Know how to delete tables
   * [X] Understand unique constraints (PRIMARY KEY)
   * [X] Remaining DML commands: UPDATE TABLE

   * [X] NULL values and how to enforce them

** SQLite
*** Delete tables

    * ~DROP TABLE [table];~

    * PRACTICE

*** Export table content only

    * You already know how to ~.dump~ an SQLite database ~.db~

    * Sometimes, you only want to export the data only, without the
      .~schema~

    * For this, you can use ~.mode insert~, then redirect the ~.output~
      and ~SELECT~ the data for the output file

    * PRACTICE

*** Export a CSV file

    * First export your file as a CSV file

    * Change ~.mode~, ~SELECT~, change ~.output~, ~SELECT~ again

    * Now you have a CSV file to import

    * PRACTICE

*** Import a CSV file

    * ~.import [csv file] [table]~

    * See help for ~.import~ on the SQLite shell

    * If you have an error, how can you fix it?

    * PRACTICE

*** Unique constraints
    * Unique constraints: ~PRIMARY KEY~

    * What happens if you have defined a column ~id~ as ~PRIMARY KEY~?

    * Try to ~INSERT~ the same ~VALUE~ in a table that already has one

    * Use ~.schema [table]~ to see your table definitions

    * PRACTICE

*** UPDATE TABLE (DML)

    * ~UPDATE~ table values with ~UPDATE [table] SET [col]=[new];~

    * If you're not careful you update entries that don't need it

    * How can you specify a row and leave others unchanged?

    * Use a filter with ~WHERE~ to specify the row!

    * PRACTICE

*** ALTER TABLE (DDL)

    * SQLite has limited capabilities to alter tables

    * You can change the name, or you can add a column, that's it

    * ~ALTER TABLE [table] RENAME TO [newname];~

    * Add a column with ~ALTER TABLE [table] ADD COLUMN [name] TEXT;~

    * PRACTICE

*** NULL values

    * ~NULL~ values are special, too

    * Check out the ~.nullvalue~ setting via ~.show~

    * Set it to ~[NULL]~ (default is "")

    * ~SELECT~ all columns of the table you just added a column to

    * Add a new column and label it ~NOT NULL~

    * PRACTICE

** Next

   * Interactive notebook (Org) to practice all of this
   * More realistic database (~food.sql~) to practice

** Mid-term grades improvement

   * You can ask me personally and specifically, what to do to get
     your grades up

   * There is no reason not to have at good grade in my class:

     1. You can usually submit in-class assignments late
     2. The deadlines of the DataCamp assignments are well known
     3. The quizzes contain ample instructions and can be repeated
     4. Class attendance + Whiteboard screenshots + GitHub info
     5. You can always talk to me for personal support

   * Hence, to improve your grade, do:

     - Submit in-class assignments if you could not attend class
     - Complete DataCamp assignments on time
     - Play the quizzes until you have 100% and read the feedback
     - Attend class + look at screenshots + files afterwards
     - Practice your skills whenever you can (e.g. DataCamp)
     - When you are attending in person, really attend
     - Ask me in or outside of class if anything is unclear

   * These skills are related to successful studying, which in turn is
     related to success in life through traditional values:
     *discipline*, *duty*, and *diligence*. This doesn't have anything
     to do with computer science.

   * What I'm going for in my classes is what I think computer
     scientists (and everyone!) need more than anything else:

     1. Critical thinking and analysis skills

     3. Research skills

     This is nicely mirrored in [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/issues/19][this comment]] to the question "Why are
     computer science degrees so math intensive when the field doesn't
     seem to use much math at all?" on Quora.

** SQLite Read-Eval-Printing-Loop in the cloud

   * Instead of a local terminal or application bundle like XAMPP, you
     can also use a cloud REPL to learn and practice SQL, SQLite

   * [X] To begin login to your Google or GitHub account

   * [ ] Register with Replit.com

     #+caption: Replit.com startup screen
     #+attr_html: :width 500px
     [[./img/replit.png]]

   * Once registered, you can pick among many language templates

   * You can create as many REPLs as you like on a free account

     #+caption: Replit.com language templates
     #+attr_html: :width 500px
     [[./img/replit1.png]]

   * Find and pick SQLite! Your REPLs are now public and shareable.

   * For example, to join the bash REPL shown below, [[https://replit.com/join/knkmkbgutq-birkenkrahe][use this link]].

     #+caption: Create a titled, shareable repl
     #+attr_html: :width 500px
     [[./img/replit2.png]]

   * You can now run SQLite commands and also access the ~bash~ shell.

   * When you execute a command in the dashboard, it's the same thing
     as
     #+begin_src bash

       sqlite3 < main.sql

     #+end_src

   * This is all made possible with a "Docker" container (with
     nix). More about that in the notes.

   * We'll get back to this when we connect SQLite to other programs

   * Today, just follow along using the REPL (or your local terminal,
     and if you don't have SQLite on your PC, [[https://www.sqlite.org/download.html][download it now]]!
     Installation is trivial. All you need is to put the location of
     the ~sqlite3.exe~ file in your ~PATH~. For Windows, you need
     ~sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3380000.zip (1.87 MiB)~.)

* SELECT lab 1: JOINs, WHERE - w9s14 (8-Mar)
** Agenda

   * [ ] Waking up in ~AppData/Roaming~? [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-to-set-a-new-emacs-home-directory][Change your Emacs HOME now]].
   * [ ] Test preparations (Test on Thursday 17-Mar)
   * [ ] Review Docker/container technology ([[file:notes.org][notes]])

** Preparations for test 2 (Thu 17-Mar)

   * Test 2 will only cover questions from quiz 4-6 + new questions.
   * You can find quiz 4-6 with solutions + feedback as PDF ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/os420/tree/main/quiz][in /quiz]])
   * I will create an update of content Org files ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/os420/tree/main/pdf][in pdf/]])

** Objectives

   * [ ] Review the entire SELECT pipeline (for SQLite)
   * [ ] Review DataCamp (deadline 'sorting/grouping')
   * [ ] Prepare for DataCamp project (sample project SQL)

** SELECT round-up

   * Download the notebook ~SELECT_roundup.org~ from GDrive (link in
     Schoology)
   * Code along with me
   * Finish the notebook on your own
   * Work through this independently using ~foods.sql~ on Thursday

* SELECT lab 1: ORDER BY, GROUP BY, LIMIT, OFFSET - w9s15 (10-Mar)

  * [X] Finish SELECT workbook [[https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1_7g2QHnAEc_4pQki6r-KRJYGcl_mdq3Y][SELECT_roundup.org (GDrive)]]
  * [X] Prepare DataCamp project: [[https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/571][Introductory SQL project]]

** Prepare DataCamp project

   The upcoming DataCamp assignment is a "guided project", which means
   that you're told, in the usual DataCamp fashion, what to do, then
   enter and run the code. This time, however, you'll be working in a
   so-called Jupyter Notebook. That's a literate programming
   environment like Emacs Org-mode (just not nearly as flexible).

   Before attempting the assigned project (deadline March 15), I
   recommend you look at the Introduction to Projects in DataCamp -
   it's very short and gives you the necessary background. [[https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/571][You find it
   here.]] You can then head over to the SQL project on international
   debt statistics.

   That's what I'm going to do!

* Quiz review, project review - w10s16 (15-Mar)

  * Preview: European Soccer League database in SQLite format
  * Review DataCamp project [[https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/754]["Analyze International Debt Statistics"]]
  * Review quiz questions Quiz 4 - 6 (PDF)

** Preview Soccer database

   I have tracked down the SQLite database version of the European
   Soccer league games. This is the dataset used in the upcoming
   DataCamp lessons. If you want to play with a much larger dataset -
   this is it: the SQLite db file is 300MB. To run it on the command
   line, use "sqlite3 soccer.sqlite" - then you're already
   there. Perfect opportunity to try some of the commands we've been
   learning on a larger canvas.

** Analyze International Debt Statistics
*** THE WORLD BANK's INTERNATIONAL DEBT DATA
    * [[https://www.worldbank.org/en/home][World Bank]] - what's the World Bank's mission?

      #+name: WorldBank
      #+begin_quote
      "The World Bank Group has two goals, to end extreme poverty and
      promote shared prosperity in a sustainable way."
      #+end_quote

    * What are the purposes of this project?

      #+name: purpose
      #+begin_quote
      * What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries
        listed in the dataset?
      * Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does
        that amount look like?
      * What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across
        different debt indicators?
      #+end_quote

    * [ ] Attributes of interest:
      - total debt by country
      - maximum of debt by country
      - average debt by country

      #+name: entities
      #+begin_example sqlite
        SELECT debt, MAX(debt), AVG(debt)
          FROM [table]
          WHERE country='...'
      #+end_example

    * [X] Connecting to ~international_debt~ database

      What exactly is "PostgreSQL" (technically)?
      - A (object-) relational database management system

      What is the "cell magic" ~%%sql~ (technically)?
      - meta data to enable query execution by the RDBMS

      #+name: table
      #+begin_example sqlite
      SELECT * FROM international_debt;
      #+end_example

    * [X] Output ~LIMIT~ to first 1-20 rows

      #+name: limit
      #+begin_example sqlite
      LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0;
      LIMIT 0, 10;
      LIMIT 10;
      #+end_example

    * [ ] Connecting to a database - what is generally involved?

      #+name: dbConnect
      #+begin_quote
      * Picking the database type (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
      * Opening the database (e.g. ~.open sqlite.db~)
      * Tables are loaded automatically
      #+end_quote

*** FINDING THE NUMBER OF DISTINCT COUNTRIES

    * [ ] DISTINCT inside or outside of COUNT()?

      Can you explain the difference?

      #+name: distinct1
      #+begin_example sql
        SELECT DISTINCT
        COUNT(country_name) AS total_distinct_countries
        FROM international_debt;
      #+end_example

      #+name: distinct2
    #+begin_example sql
      SELECT
      COUNT(DISTINCT country_name) AS total_distinct_countries
      FROM international_debt;
    #+end_example

    #+begin_quote
    In the first example, no column has been selected so the
    operator/function ~DISTINCT~ has nothing to act upon.

    In the second example, the number of unique countries is
    selected - ~DISTINCT country_name~ throws away any rows with the
    same value in ~country_name~.
    #+end_quote

*** FINDING OUT THE DISTINCT DEBT INDICATORS

    * [X] ORDER BY
      - what does it order?
      - what's the default?
      - how can the default be changed?

      #+begin_quote
      ORDER BY orders all values of a column in ascending (ASC) order
      unless the keyword DESC is used (descending order) after the
      column name.
      #+end_quote

*** TOTALING THE AMOUNT OF DEBT OWED BY THE COUNTRIES

    * [X] Aggregate function with 2nd argument: ROUND(column,precision)

      - [[https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-round/][More about ~ROUND~]]
      - A 'million million" is a trillion, better: 10^12 (1e+12)

      #+name: round
      #+begin_example sql
        SELECT
        ROUND(SUM(debt)/100000, 2) AS total_debt
        FROM international_debt;
      #+end_example

*** COUNTRY WITH THE HIGHEST DEBT

    * Did you expect the answer?
    * [[https://www.visualcapitalist.com/global-debt-to-gdp-ratio/][Check out this visualization (2021)]] - what's the difference?
    * [[https://datatopics.worldbank.org/debt/ids/country/CHN][International debt statistics breakdown]]

    #+name: highestDebt
    #+begin_example sql
      SELECT country_name, sum(debt) AS total_debt
       FROM international_debt
       GROUP BY country_name
       ORDER BY total_debt DESC
       LIMIT 1;
    #+end_example

*** AVERAGE AMOUNT OF DEBT ACROSS INDICATORS

    * GROUP BY two columns - what does that mean?
    * What happens if you take the 2nd argument away?

    #+name: groupBy1
    #+begin_quote
    GROUP BY x,y means "put all rows with the same values for BOTH x
    and y in the same group".
    #+end_quote

    #+name: groupBy2
    #+begin_example sql
      SELECT
       indicator_code AS debt_indicator,
       indicator_name,
       AVG(debt) AS average_debt
       FROM international_debt
       GROUP BY debt_indicator, indicator_name
       ORDER BY average_debt DESC
       LIMIT 10;
    #+end_example

    System message:

    #+end_example

    [[http://sqlalche.me/e/f405][See SQLalchemy link]]

*** THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS

    * What's special about the filtering with WHERE?
    * What's the [[https://www.w3resource.com/PostgreSQL/postgresql-subqueries.php][subquery nesting]] depth allowed?

    #+name: where
    #+begin_example sql
      SELECT country_name, indicator_name
       FROM international_debt
       WHERE debt= (SELECT max(debt)
                     FROM international_debt
                     WHERE indicator_code='DT.AMT.DLXF.CD');
    #+end_example

*** THE MOST COMMON DEBT INDICATOR

    * ORDER BY with two arguments - is the order important?
    * What happens if you turn the arguments around?

      #+name: orderBy
      #+begin_example sql
        SELECT indicator_code, COUNT(indicator_code) AS indicator_count
        FROM international_debt
        GROUP BY indicator_code
        ORDER BY indicator_count DESC, indicator_code DESC
        LIMIT 20;

     #+begin_quote

»The traditional math professor of the popular legend is
absentminded. He usually appears in public with a lost umbrella in
each hand. He prefers to face the blackboard and to turn his back
on the class. He writes ~a~, he says ~b~, he means ~c~, but it should be
~d~. Some of his sayings are handed down from generation to
generation:

/"In order to solve this differential equation you look at it till
a solution *occurs* to you."/

/"This principle is so perfectly general that no particular
*application* of it is possible."/

/"Geometry is the art of correct *reasoning* on incorrect figures."/

   The final exam will take place *in room 104 of the Lyon building*
   (our usual classroom) on *Saturday, May 7 from 1.00 pm to 3.00 pm*
   ([[https://assets.speakcdn.com/assets/2433/sp22_final_exam_schedule_final-2022042203012665.pdf][see exam schedule]]).

   The exam will consist of 40 questions drawn at random from the
   pool of quiz and test questions. Completing the various quizzes
   and tests until you've reached 100%, and revisiting your past
   tests should enable you to pass this exam with flying colors!

   Please reach out to me if you have difficulties taking the exam at
   this time. I'm going to offer a limited number of seats to take
   this exam on Friday May 6 or on Monday May 9. Graduating seniors
   must complete the exam no later than May 8.

** Beyond SQL
*** MongoDB playground
**** Video summary & analysis

     * Entities = Collections + Tables
     * Documents = Schema-less (Rows)
     * Good for: missing values (NAs)
     * Advantage: flexibility for expansion
     * Graph sorting algorithms
     * Programming with dictionaries (Python), lists (R)
     * Less merging, faster searches, duplicate data

     * Video presents possibilities - for OLAP, storage, performance
       and scaling are only two aspects. More important to providers
       than to (analytical) users.

     * Additional issue: hardware dependency - which technology makes
       best use of existing and potential performance boosts like
       - parallelization (code issue = RDBMS + query)
       - quantum computing (e.g. cybersecurity applications)
       - distributed data (e.g. many small data centers)

     * Meta issue: the way in which data are organized impact our
       ability to discern and display facts about the world!

     * Real world dependencies: Google had to go back to SQL services
       because most real world web applications rely on SQL databases

     * NoSQL is not a new paradigm. There hasn't been a new paradigm in
       database technology for 70 years... (something like OOP)

     * NoSQL is actually kind of an old paradigm because collections
       resemble spreadsheets more than relational databases

**** Playing with MongoDB

    * If you want to try out MongoDB (popular NoSQL database) [[https://www.pdbmbook.com/practice][see here]]
    * Docker container image for download or online playground
    * Regular SQL (MySQL), MongoDB, Cypher (graph database language)
    * NoSQL databases require much more effort to do OLAP

    * To try:
      - ~db.getCollectionNames();~ (returns collection names)
      - ~db.products.dataSize();~ (returns collection size)

*** RDBMS for data science: DuckDB

    * Data scientists (and OLAP[fn:7] people) don't like/use RDBMS:
      - They're really slow (subqueries?)
      - Queries are hard to optimize (1960s programming)
      - Little parallelism
      - No out-of-memory computation (like interpreted language)
      - No transactional storage

    * Re-think RDBMS from the benefit backwards, not from the available
      technology forward!

    * Some *Germans* (!) have created a state-of-the-art analytical DBMS
      - It's free, open source and bypasses expensive consultants
      - It's fast and comfortable
      - It's written in C++ and supports SQL (PostgreSQL syntax)
      - APIs for C, C++, Python, CLI, Python, R, Java, Julia, Go...
      - It's in-process like SQLite (!)
      - No external dependencies (like "Tidyverse") - raw power
      - [[https://arrow.apache.org/docs/index.html][Apache Arrow]] table and [[https://parquet.apache.org/][Apache Parquet]] format support[fn:6]
      - Focus on R (visualization and analysis > table munging)

    * They called it DuckDB because ducks are cute (and tasty)

    * [[https://duckdb.org/demo/][Online playground available]]

    * [[https://youtu.be/Z-6SnP6yzgo][Intro talk by Hannes Mühleisen]] at NYhackr (Mar 1, 2022)

*** DataCamp webinar: work of a Data Engineer

    * [[https://www.datacamp.com/resources/webinars/impactful-data-engineering-with-datadogs-wouter-de-bie][Check out the recent webinar + slides]]
    * Interesting industry-relevant take on data work
    * "Custom SQL" and management tools
      - Versioning (= Git as in GitHub)
      - Data Warehousing (OLAP, Apache tools)
      - Dashboarding (Tableau, R Shiny)

** Final Exam Review

   * [ ] *Any outstanding work must be finished by Monday May 9*
   * [ ] Discuss questions not in the last block (Q7-Q9/Test 3)
   * [ ] Will curate & modify questions here and there before Sat

** Evaluation

   * [ ] Changes that I would make:
     1. More non-SQL: MongoDB demo, DuckDB, GraphDB, XML
     2. Group project: building, connecting, running a DB
     3. Fewer DataCamp assignments, more DIY notebooks
     4. Homework should include reading articles/book chapters

   * [ ] *Please take 10 minutes to complete the course evaluation now*

[fn:7]OLAP = OnLine Analytic Processing, part of Business Intelligence
or BI, including relational database querying, data and process mining

[fn:6]Arrow is for efficient tabular formatting of data, Parquet for
efficient storage, where "efficiency" relates to the ability to
analyze very large amounts of data fast.

[fn:5]Think about it: when you read a book (on paper, not on the
screen), you work your way through much more like with a notebook:
e.g. you read around the text, you flip through pages to find stuff
you forgot, you look way ahead to see what else is there etc. This is
arguably much more effective than just watching something, though less
effective (I find) than trying to comprehend through re-creating the
material (which also double-checks it - never trust anyone blindly
:-).

[fn:4]On Windows, Emacs Org-mode cannot handle

[fn:3]It is not true that a "table is like a
spreadsheet". Spreadsheets contain active fields for
computation. Org-mode tables are actually spreadsheet-enabled:
#+begin_example
|         2 |
|         5 |
|         7 |
|-----------|
| 4.6666667 |
#+TBLFM: @5$1=vmean(@1..@4)
#+end_example

[fn:2]In Lyon 104 (Computer lab), the ~PATH~ variable is unfortunately
stored in the personal user's app data so that I could not set it
properly for your account (you can do this on your own PC
easily). However, [[file:FAQ.org][I seem to have found a solution]] for this ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/db330/blob/main/FAQ.org#how-to-run-sqlite-in-emacs][see course
FAQ]]).

[fn:1]For installation on your PC, see [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/emacs/install.org][these instructions]] ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/emacs/install.pdf][PDF]]). The
installation is simple: download the ZIP file, unpack it, and set the
~PATH~ variable so that sqlite can be found.
