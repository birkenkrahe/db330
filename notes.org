* README

  Instead of bugging you with emails, I opt to summarize my course
  observations regarding content, process, in this file. These often
  contain additional links, articles, and musings.

  I usually update it after each class - it also contains the homework
  (if any). The first point of call for any questions should be the
  FAQ. There are two FAQs - a [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#frequently-asked-questions][general one]] (for all my courses), and a
  [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/db330/blob/main/FAQ.org][FAQ for CSC 330]].

  You find the whiteboard photos [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AUgfVPV26mCglrEPPPKPCwfkmiFhkx8R?usp=sharing][here in GDrive]].


  The companion file to this file, with the agenda and much of the
  course content, is the [[./agenda.org][agenda.org]] file.

* Intro and GitHub - w1s1 (01/11/22)

** Homework (by Thursday 13-Jan)

   * Register with GitHub (2 min)
   * Complete the GitHub Hello World exercise (20 min)
   * +Give me your GitHub user name (email - with course ID - or
     Thursday in class) - so that I can add you to the repo+ - no
     need, course is public now
   * Submit an issue to the course repo confirming that you completed
     the exercise.

   Note: if you already did this as part of another course, you don't
   have to do it again but you need to let me know in your email,
   which of my courses you attend so that I can add you to one or more
   GitHub repos.

** Stuff

   * [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/db330/blob/main/agenda.org][Agenda]] - we covered all of it (and more) - agenda is available in
     GitHub only.

   * Books: "Crafting Interpreters" by Nystrom (2021) is a fun book on
     creating a small interpreted programming language. This would be
     an extra cool (Honors) project in a course on programming
     languages!

     #+attr_html: :width 600px
     [[./img/nystrom.png]]

   * Pyret (thank you, Molly!) - [[https://www.pyret.org/index.html][check it out]].

   * Showed GitHub, DataCamp teams and assignments, and GNU Emacs. We
     talked about structured vs. unstructured data, and Torvald's Git
     version control program: which follows a key-value data model -
     all data (committed differences) are stored in tree-like
     structures and indexed by hash codes. [[https://medium.com/hackernoon/https-medium-com-zspajich-understanding-git-data-model-95eb16cc99f5][See here for more]] (Spajic,
     2018).

   * The DataCamp platform supports the three most important data
     science languages (in order of importance in the real world):
     SQL, R, Python. You can do data science with the shell (bash), or
     even with Java, C, or any other language of course. The season's
     last assignment is a project where you can see all that you
     learnt about SQL at work: an anlysis of international debt
     statistics. You do not need to work on the assignments in any
     particular order - as long as you don't miss the weekly
     deadlines. A weekly assignment should take 20-30 minutes of your
     time.

     #+attr_html: :width 600px
     #+caption: DataCamp project - Analyze Intern. Debt Stats
     [[./img/project.png]]

   * Recorded a screencast for the missing 10 minutes at the end
     (network outage in Batesville!) - [[https://youtu.be/8HJGz3IYoHI][see on YouTube here]]
     (Birkenkrahe, 2022). This is a demonstration of the differences
     of interactive shell scripting vs. interactive notebooks, using
     SQLite as a sample language. You will get an assignment to create
     a literate programming file next week. Don't be put off by the
     level of detail of this demo - let it all just wash over you for
     now - you'll learn this and much more in this course!

     #+attr_html: :width 600px
     [[./img/demo.png]]

     In the screencast I talk about missing syntax highlighting in the
     shell buffer on the left: "I could add it if I wanted to." This
     is true - everything is Emacs is customizable, and I spent years,
     literally, doing this. [[https://wikemacs.org/wiki/Shell][Here is the documentation]] specifically on
     customizing the shell, if you're curious. The language to do this
     is Emacs-Lisp, a Lisp dialect. I mentioned that Lisp was the
     [[https://medium.com/ai-society/the-lisp-approach-to-ai-part-1-a48c7385a913][first and, for a long time, dominant AI language]] (Valencia,
     2017). It's a great language to learn, and GNU Emacs is the
     ticket if you feel like it.

* DataCamp, History of DB, MooCall - w1s2 (01/13/22)
** DataCamp membership

   * DataCamp: You should all be in your courses now.
     - Your assignments are on one page but you'll be notified via
       schoology as soon as an assignment is due

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   #+caption: DataCamp DB course member list
   [[./img/members.png]]

** History of databases

   * [[https://youtu.be/KG-mqHoXOXY][YouTube video link]]

     #+attr_html: :width 400px
     #+caption: Which of these founders has nothing to do with databases?
     [[./img/founders.png]]

   * DB are an old human interest (information is always gathered)

   * DB development happened in close "combat" with companies and
     operating systems (market and a hardware aspect to it)

   * Dominant language is SQL - in connection with relational DB

   * Codd's 12 rules = everything you need to know about relational
     DB design (these rules scale extremely well)

   * There are MANY different types of DBMS

   * We'll be installing SQLite, too, for local SQL experimentation

** DBMS IoT example application (MooCall)

   * Website for this [[https://www.moocall.com/#][Irish app]]

     #+attr_html: :width 400px
     #+caption: Two cows with MooCall sensors attached.
     [[./img/moocall.jpg]]

   * Sensor applications are small and look trivial, but they're
     highly security relevant (Cernobyl disaster in USSR, 1986). See
     [[https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/dietrich-dorner/the-logic-of-failure/9780201479485/][The Logic of Failure (Dorner, 1997)]].

     #+attr_html: :width 300px
     [[./img/dorner.jpg]]

   * Big Data ("starts" modern data science) = 3Vs = Volume +
     Velocity + Variety [5V definitions add "value", "veracity"]

   * IoT = "webservice"-enabled, cloud-networked, fast, big data
     applications

   * MooCall DB networking:
     1) cow data are generated and pre-processed locally (e.g. cow ID,
        temperature, motion etc.) = "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing][edge computing]]" example
     2) cow data are processed globally (in the cloud) to generate
        user signal ("this cow's calving!")
     3) Signal is transmitted to the user = farmer for potential
        action.

   * DB system = DBMS + DB - the DBMS has a lot of fancy stuff on
     board: performance optimizer, shell, API

   * BC (Before Codd) = file system-based data management, and AC (After
     Codd) = DB management system (DBMS)-based data management.

** GNU Emacs installation

   * Install vanilla[fn:1] GNU Emacs or a modified Emacs (for statistics
     processing with R and other packages - [[https://ess.r-project.org/][ESS]])

   * Vanilla GNU Emacs v27 Windows installation: you need the
     ~emacs-27.1-x86_64-installer.exe~ [[http://gnu.freemirror.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-27/][from this page]].

   * MacOS: get the [[https://vigou3.gitlab.io/emacs-modified-macos/][modified version]] if you like (easiest), or the
     binary using the command line terminal as shown [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html][here]], using the
     ~Homebrew~ package manager.

     #+attr_html: :width 300px
     #+caption:GNU Emacs v27 download online repo
     [[./img/download.png]]

   * Demo: keyboard macros. I showed how to define a keyboard macro
     (~C-x (~ [key sequence] ~C-x )~) and how to apply it repeatedly
     (~C-u [times] C-x e~). [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macros.html][Here's the documentation]].

* DB elements, GNU Emacs - w2s3 (01/18/22)
** Quiz 1

   THE QUIZ IS ON ... SCHOOLOGY 1 PM - 1.15 PM

*** Feedback/discussion

    FOLLOWED by brief FEEDBACK:

    * We'll do one of these per week (I hope)
    * Any content questions?
    * Too much time? Too little?
    * Questions too hard? Too easy?
    * A subset of these questions will become the final exam
    * After playing the quiz in class you can play it unlimited times
    * Quizzes are now *ungraded* (final exam is now 30% of final grade)

** Review: file vs database approach

   #+attr_html: :width 600px

   * strong vs. soft/loose coupling is an important design issue (it
     relates directly to the resilience of the designed system).

   * *meta data* are data about data, used to control, manage other
     data, and processes

   * Example: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif][Exif (Exchangeable Image File)]] data are an example of
     common meta data associated with image files stored alongside
     digital pictures.

   * SQL (Structured Query Language): dominant language for
     structured, table-based (aka relational) databases
     - DQL = Data Query Language (e.g. selecting data)
     - DDL = Data Definition Language (e.g. creating tables)
     - DML = Data Manipulation Language (e.g. input/output of data)
     - DCL = Data Control Language (to alter meta data, e.g. rights)

   * Learning anything is best as a "variation on a theme" (as in
     music)

   * MooCall: what do we want to store (cow temperature F, in C)

   * State-based view of computing (von Neumann architecture) =
     dominant paradigm (automata, Turing machines...)

** GNU Emacs tour

   * Ctrl-h Ctrl-a RET : Startup screen
   * Emacs written in C and Lisp (Emacs Lisp)
   * Emacs is an IDE - we'll use it for SQL, SQLite, and bash
   * Emacs contains a bunch of apps (e.g. file explorer)
   * Try the Emacs onboard tutorial (CTRL-h t)
   * What Emacs can do:
     - Extension and full customization (with Emacs Lisp)
     - Writing in many different human/programming/markup
       languages (with major and minor modes)
     - IDE work (compile, run, test programs) - gdb integration
     - Compare and highlight file differences (with ediff)
     - Manage files (with dired)
     - Read mail, news, RSS feeds (gnus)
     - You can use it as an IRC reader (#batesville@irc.freenode.net)
     - Play games ([[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/fun-games-in-emacs][examples]])

       #+begin_quote
       Whenever you decide to start using Emacs, you should take the Emacs tutorial. It's an interactive hands-on which will familiarize you with many things, including:

       * Starting and exiting Emacs
       * Basic text movement and editing commands
       * Opening and saving files
       * Emacs concepts: windows, frames, files, and buffers
       * Invoking commands with keybindings and with M-x
       * To run the tutorial, start Emacs and type C-h t, that is,
         Ctrl-h followed by t.
       #+end_quote

* SQLite installation - w2s4 (01/20/22)
** Captain's Log

   * GNU Emacs reference car ("cheat sheet") [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/emacs/refcard.pdf][on GitHub (PDF)]]

   * We looked at different reasons to use the Emacs editor/IDE

   * For installation of the software we need (Emacs, SQLite), which
     is already done on the PCs in the computer lab, check [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/emacs/install.org][install.org]]
     in GitHub

   * To get better at moving through Emacs buffers, manage files etc.,
     complete the GNU Emacs onboard tutorial (open it in Emacs with
     ~C-h t~)

   * We'll go through a more systematic training session (including
     Org-mode) next week.

* Cloud computing intro - w3s5 (01/25/22)
** Cloud computing - "the old curmudgeon's view"

   * Spending on cloud services in 2020: $bn 266 - projected to $bn 308
     in 2021 (DataCamp). However ([[https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48776122#:~:text=For%20the%20full%20year%202021,after%20two%20years%20of%20declines.][IDC, 2022]])

     #+caption: Cloud service spending data (IDC, 2022)

     [[./img/cloud.png]]

   * What's the GDP of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland][Finland]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam][Vietnam]]?

   * On-premise vs cloud discussion - major business issue - why?

   * Main messages: cloud is huge, good for access, scaling is an issue

   * Amazon Web Services is highlighted (why?) What about other
     providers? How do they differ? What kind of market is this?

   * What do you think of the AWS products page from a logical point of
     view?

     #+caption: aws products and services (DataCamp, 2020).
     #+attr_html: :width 600px
     [[./img/aws.png]]

   * Virtualization = your OS over the internet

   * Vertical (server power) vs. horizontal scaling (server number)

   * Data centers - cp. [[https://h5p.org/node/84879]["Inside Google's Data Centers" (H5P/YouTube)]]

   * How are Lyon's data served - what about the safekeeping?

     #+caption: On-demand cloud vs. on-premise data centers
     #+attr_html: :width 400px

**   Captain's Log Star Date 99667.82

   * Use case diagrams are part of the Unified Modeling Language
     (UML). Here is a good, short, free [[https://youtu.be/zid-MVo7M-E][online video tutorial]]
     ([[uml][Lucidchart, 2018]]). UML is a visual language to describe
     information systems.

   * We discussed a bank (more specifically a retail, or consumer
     bank) as an example. It is not a good use case for cloud
     computing, because the data are confidential, structured, don't
     change much, and are small. Banks more often use on-premise
     relational database management systems (RDBMS) and SQL, than
     cloud-based systems.

   * When we ask (about a table, or a diagram, or a graph, or any
     scheme), "is this logical?", we mean "is this well ordered, or
     ordered at all, fit for human understanding." There is a whole
     method, the so-called "Minto Pyramid Principle" built around this
     concept of ordering content so that it is fit for human
     understanding. Here is a short [[https://vimeo.com/305393045][online video tutorial on Minto]]
     ([[minto][Harrison Metal, 2019]]).

   * "Shell inside a shell": when we open the Windows terminal, or
     Command prompt (~cmd.exe~), and then start a program like
     ~sqlite3~, we operate in a shell inside another shell.

   * REPL = Read-Eval-Print-Loop - cloud-based application to learn
     programming: [[https://replit.com][replit.com]].

* Cloud deployment - w4s6 (02/01/22)
** DataCamp assignment - cloud deployment

   * Deployment models: private, public, hybrid, multicloud, community

   * Negative personal example (hybrid): RStudio cloud

   * Positive personal example (public): Colaboratory + GDrive,
     DataCamp Workspace

   * Nice exercise: build a NextCloud server with Raspberry Pi

   * EU GDPR - the true story: a major pain with unclear gains

   * Is there a US equivalent of the General Data Privacy Regulation
     act of the EU?[fn:3]

   * "What is personal data?" is an interesting question - why?[fn:4]

   * How international is the Internet really? (What is its backbone,
     where are public data held, and who owns the infrastructure?

   * How do "cloud computing roles" relate to "database roles"?

   * How can you improve your "cloud computing skills"? What are they?
     (Examples: [[https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-full-stack-cloud-developer][IBM@coursera.org]], [[https://www.edx.org/learn/cloud-computing][EdX cloud computing courses]], [[https://cloud.google.com/certification#certification_paths][Google]])

   * Overlap with data science: analysis (EDA), engineering (pipeline
     building and maintenance), and modeling (ML)

   * Database apps: Tableau etc. all based on SQL = top skill

   * Buzzword (2010-2020): "Digital transformation of the company"

** Captain's Log Stardate 99687.04

   * If you don't have the Linux program ~touch~ on Windows, you can
     use this command to create an empty file in the current
     directory:
     #+begin_example
      $ fsutil file createNew test.db 0
     #+end_example

   * An even simpler way is by opening the RDBM program and create a
     DB at the same time with the command ~sqlite3 test.db~ at the
     prompt.

   * [[https://docs.nextcloudpi.com/en/welcome/][NextCloudPi]] contains documentation to use the cloud computing
     software ~NextCloud~ on the Raspberry Pi. Somewhere in there
     you'll find what it takes to build a backup server with
     ~NextCloud~ (which was one of my projects).

* DB dump and output, SELECT pipeline - w6s10 - February 17, 2022
** "Be the shell!": in-class assignment

   See also my [[https://youtu.be/-mKBQdgZFTE][screencast]] (12 min) with script in [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/db330/blob/main/sqlite/Be_The_Shell_Feb_17.pdf][GitHub]] (PDF).

   1) Start SQLite with header on and column mode switched on from
      the command line (to find out, look at ~sqlite3 --help~).

      *Solution:* On the command line[fn:9], enter
      #+begin_example
      $ sqlite3 -header -column~
      #+end_example

   2) Check that you don't have a persistent database with ~.database~.

      *Solution:*
      #+begin_example
      sqlite>  .database
      #+end_example

   3) Open your (existing) database ~sqlite.db~ with ~.open~

      *Solution:*
      #+begin_example
      sqlite>  .open sqlite.db
      #+end_example

      This database does not need to exist yet - if it does not, the
      binary file is created as an empty file in the directory where
      you were when you opened SQLite.
   
   4) Check that you're now writing to ~sqlite.db~

      *Solution:*
      #+begin_example
      sqlite>  .database
      #+end_example

      You could also enter ~.show~ - the last line of its output shows
      the currently active database. You can change databases and have
      as many open as you like.
   
   5) Check that in fact header is ~ON~ and the mode is ~column~
      - with ~.show~ to show all output values
      - with ~SELECT~

      *Solution:*
      #+begin_example
      sqlite> .show
      sqlite> SELECT * FROM customer;
      #+end_example

      This presumes that you have created at least one table named
      ~customer~, and that it is in your database ~sqlite.db~, and
      that the table has at least one row - otherwise nothing will be
      displayed. 
   
   6) Switch the output to a file with ~.output sqlite.sql~

      *Solution:*
      #+begin_example
      sqlite> .output sqlite.sql
      #+end_example

      ~.output~ is one of the settings you saw with ~.show~. It shows
      where the output is directed. The default is ~stdout~, or the
      screen. You have now reset this to pipe all output into a file
      ~sqlite.sql~.
   
   7) Dump the content of your database with ~.dump~

      *Solution:*
      #+begin_example
      sqlite> .dump
      #+end_example

      This writes a version of the binary ~.db~ file to a text file
      ~.sql~. It contains all the information necessary to recreate
      the database. This ~.sql~ can be used to port the database. On
      another computer, SQLite will recreate ~sqlite.db~ from
      ~sqlite.sql~ by importing it with the ~.read~ command.
   
   8) Switch the output back to ~stdout~

      *Solution:*
      #+begin_example
      sqlite> .output stdout
      sqlite> .show
      #+end_example

      Until we redirect the output to ~stdout~, every output we
      generate, including error messages, will be redirected to the
      ~.sql~ file.
   
   9) Dump the content of your database again.

      *Solution:*
      #+begin_example
      sqlite> .dump
      #+end_example

      Instead of dumping to an SQL file, we are now dumping the
      database to the screen.
      
   10) Leave the SQLite shell and look at ~sqlite.sql~

      *Solution:*
      #+begin_example
      sqlite> .q
      #+end_example

      Depending on your PC (it doesn't seem to work under MacOS), the
      ~.shell~ command can be used to peek beyond the SQLite shell,
      and you could use this command to look at the directory
      listing - under Windows: ~.shell DIR~.

* SQLite import/export, NULL, UNIQUE - w7s11 - February 22, 2022

  * [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server][Apache HTTP server]] still seems to be the dominant HTTP server
    software. [[https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html][XAMPP]], the package featured in class, contains a fork of
    MySQL, MariaDB, and a GUI to use the RDBMS graphically. There are
    many GUIs and XAMPP is still the easiest to install, I
    think. XAMPP's original purpose is not for DB training though but
    for easy web development (you have all the tools you need on your
    PC). We're going to look at this in class - however, I'm not going
    to install XAMPP on every lab PC, so if you wish to tag along, you
    need to bring your laptop to class. I'm going to make an
    installation video.
    
  * FAQ: It's bugged me from the start of the course that GNU Emacs on
    Windoze did not seem to allow to run SQLite in a shell. Turns out
    that's not true! The issue is merely cosmetic: the SQLite shell
    prompt is not shown is all.

  * Here are a couple of screenshots both from Windoze - the first is
    the SQLite shell inside an terminal Emacs shell (start Emacs from
    the CMD line with ~emacs -nw~), the second is from within the
    Ubuntu app (20.04 LTS), also the terminal Emacs.

[fn:9] Org-mode has 11 different header arguments ([[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-sqlite.html][see here]]) - you can
initialize SQLite with the header shown below. A separate session
buffer is not supported[fn:8] - SQLite is run outside of Emacs and the
results are displayed here. For a session demonstrating SQLite
commands (which begin with a ~.~), Org-mode is not well suited. For
SQL commands, it is well suited.
#+begin_example
  #+begin_src sqlite :db ./sqlite/sqlite.db :header :column :results output
    ...
  #+end_src
#+end_example


#+end_src


[fn:8]Such a session buffer opens e.g. when you start R with ~M-x R~.

[fn:6]If you had the order SaaS-Paas-IaaS correct in either direction,
you got the full point for this question.

[fn:7]This is a nice R project that I'm pursuing right now: loading
the data into a data frame and analysing the results to find out if
there is a correlation between the different factors.

[fn:5][[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1202770/hyperscaler-iaas-paas-market-share/][Statista]] numbers (no source given) for 2021.

[fn:4]Privacy is a political term. Private information can also be an
entry to phishing or other network-based activities compromising the
security of your PC.

[fn:3] There is no federal data privacy law like GDPR in the United
States. There are some national laws that have been put in place to
regulate the use of data in certain industries, e.g. The 1974
U.S. Privacy Act (rights and restrictions regarding data held by US
government agencies), or the 2018 California Consumer Privacy Act
(rights and protection for CA residents).

[fn:2][[https://youtu.be/T2bSMLEQX1o]["Logic, logic...I'm sick to death of logic!"]] (Star Trek:
Captain's Log)

[fn:1]The term "vanilla" refers to the fact that this is the
uncustomized, original version of Emacs. For large, old open source
projects, this is a bit of a mystery, though, since so many versions
exist that it may be difficult to identify "the original".
